As a Director/Manager in our organization, I've always sought to embody a balance of technical and managerial skills. This is evident in my involvement with both the Control-M initiatives and the SRE Self-Service projects. 

In our Control-M initiatives, I've played more than just an overseeing role. I've been involved technically, troubleshooting complex issues, resolving bottlenecks, and actively participating in the project execution. This has not only required a deep technical understanding but also necessitated strategic decision-making, strong negotiation skills, and effective communication, especially in the areas of vendor management and SOW revisions.

With the SRE Self-Service projects, I've had the chance to get hands-on, especially in areas such as database migration and changes to business logic. The successful launch and adoption of our Adhoc Control-M UAT module, which has seen over 125K user actions and the use by over 40 app teams, is a testament to the vital role I've played. The TrueSight Blackout module, which has already handled over 1100 blackout requests, was another project that saw me deeply involved from a technical standpoint.

I've also had the opportunity to train and groom two cloud interns, imparting technical knowledge and skills necessary for cloud engineering. Our collective efforts in AMI build automation and AWS cost calculation/validation have been promising.

During the past couple of months, I faced personal challenges due to family relocation, which necessitated a shift in focus. The unwavering support I received from the team during this time was heartening and I am grateful for their understanding.

Aside from these key projects, I've managed other initiatives like license renewals without impacting BAU operations, infrastructure roadmap planning, obsolescence management, and business continuity management. These responsibilities require a broad view of the organization's needs and the ability to strategize, plan, and execute effectively.

As we move into the second half of the year, I am motivated and ready to continue driving our team's progress. Despite personal challenges, my commitment to our team and our objectives remains steadfast. I am excited about what we can achieve together in the coming months.

Over the past year, I've had the opportunity to lead a talented and dedicated team while juggling a variety of responsibilities. My role spans strategic leadership, technical guidance, project management, and team development.

I've overseen the Control-M initiatives where I've been hands-on in resolving complex technical issues that were beyond our vendor's reach. Identifying and rectifying performance bottlenecks in Control-M has been one of my key contributions.

My efforts have also extended to the successful launch of new self-service capabilities. The Adhoc Control-M UAT module that we launched has seen great adoption, registering 125K user actions and being used by over 40 app teams in the first half of this year alone. Furthermore, the TrueSight Blackout module has been a significant release under my guidance, effectively supporting over 1100 blackout requests to date.

The project of creating a self-service for the Bill of Material and Infra build form request faced a hiccup due to resource attrition. However, I've been committed to keeping the initiative afloat by actively seeking the right personnel.

As part of my responsibility towards team development, I've taken two cloud interns under my wing. I'm actively training them on cloud engineering and we're working together on AMI build automation and AWS cost calculation/validation.

I've also managed to successfully complete an audit and contract renewal while ensuring our budget tracking and resource allocation are top-notch. System roadmap tracking, business continuity management, new resource onboarding, and obsolescence management are other areas I've been diligently managing.

June and July were challenging months for me personally due to my family relocating and facing health issues. This did affect my focus to some extent, but I appreciate the management's support during this period. I'm now ready to harness my energy and direct it towards our goals for the second half of the year.

Overall, despite the challenges, I believe I've maintained a balance of strategic leadership, technical proficiency, and operational efficiency. As I move forward, I'm committed to continue driving our team's progress and setting the stage for future successes.
