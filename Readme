Over the past year, I've had the opportunity to lead a talented and dedicated team while juggling a variety of responsibilities. My role spans strategic leadership, technical guidance, project management, and team development.

I've overseen the Control-M initiatives where I've been hands-on in resolving complex technical issues that were beyond our vendor's reach. Identifying and rectifying performance bottlenecks in Control-M has been one of my key contributions.

My efforts have also extended to the successful launch of new self-service capabilities. The Adhoc Control-M UAT module that we launched has seen great adoption, registering 125K user actions and being used by over 40 app teams in the first half of this year alone. Furthermore, the TrueSight Blackout module has been a significant release under my guidance, effectively supporting over 1100 blackout requests to date.

The project of creating a self-service for the Bill of Material and Infra build form request faced a hiccup due to resource attrition. However, I've been committed to keeping the initiative afloat by actively seeking the right personnel.

As part of my responsibility towards team development, I've taken two cloud interns under my wing. I'm actively training them on cloud engineering and we're working together on AMI build automation and AWS cost calculation/validation.

I've also managed to successfully complete an audit and contract renewal while ensuring our budget tracking and resource allocation are top-notch. System roadmap tracking, business continuity management, new resource onboarding, and obsolescence management are other areas I've been diligently managing.

June and July were challenging months for me personally due to my family relocating and facing health issues. This did affect my focus to some extent, but I appreciate the management's support during this period. I'm now ready to harness my energy and direct it towards our goals for the second half of the year.

Overall, despite the challenges, I believe I've maintained a balance of strategic leadership, technical proficiency, and operational efficiency. As I move forward, I'm committed to continue driving our team's progress and setting the stage for future successes.
